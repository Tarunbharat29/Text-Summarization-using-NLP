# 📝 Text Summarization Using spaCy (with Web UI)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a lightweight **text summarization model** built using the **spaCy** NLP library. It is designed to automatically condense lengthy text into concise and informative summaries by extracting the most relevant sentences. A simple and intuitive **web-based UI** built using **HTML** and **CSS** allows users to easily input text and view the generated summary.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Summarize long text into short, meaningful summaries.
- Extract key information using NLP techniques.
- Provide a clean and user-friendly web interface for real-time summarization.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Tech | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Python** | Backend logic & summarization |
| **spaCy** | Natural Language Processing |
| **HTML** | Frontend structure |
| **CSS** | Frontend styling |
| **Flask** *(optional)* | For running the UI on a local server (if used) |

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Preprocessing**: Input text is cleaned and tokenized.
2. **Sentence Scoring**: Sentences are scored based on word frequencies.
3. **Summarization**: Top-ranked sentences are selected to form the summary.
4. **UI**: Users can paste or type text into a browser-based form and get instant summaries.
